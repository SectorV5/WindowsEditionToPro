# WindowsEditionToPro

`WindowsEditionToPro.ps1` is a PowerShell script for performing an **in-place upgrade** of almost any Windows edition to Windows 11 Pro.  It works even on ‚Äúnonstandard‚Äù builds (Enterprise, Education, LTSC/LTSB, IoT, etc.), keeping your files and apps intact. The script uses **official Windows installation media** (no cracks or hacks) and requires a valid Windows 11 Pro license key.

## üîß Features

* üõ† **In-place upgrade** to Windows 11 Pro from a wide range of editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, Education, IoT, LTSC, etc.).
* ‚òëÔ∏è **Keeps files and apps** ‚Äì performs a repair-install style upgrade without wiping your data.
* üì• **Official ISO download** ‚Äì auto-fetches the Windows 11 ISO using the [Fido](https://github.com/pbatard/Fido) script (which automates access to Microsoft‚Äôs retail ISO links) or via manual download.
* üîÑ **Fallback options** ‚Äì if automated download fails, it can fall back to the [MAS (Massgrave) download page](https://massgrave.dev/genuine-installation-media) for genuine ISOs or use a manually downloaded ISO (from Microsoft or other trusted sources).
* üîë **Handles licensing prompts** ‚Äì automatically accepts the EULA and prompts for the Windows 11 Pro product key. Requires a valid key (it does *not* bypass activation).
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Multi-edition ISO support** ‚Äì works with Microsoft‚Äôs multi-edition ISO (which selects the edition via product key).
* üíØ **Genuine media only** ‚Äì uses only official Microsoft or MAS-sourced ISOs (all download links are verified as genuine files).

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Prerequisites:**  Ensure you have a **valid Windows 11 Pro product key** and are running Windows 8 or later.
2. **Obtain Windows 11 ISO:** The script will attempt to download the official ISO via the Fido tool.  If that fails or offline, manually download the Windows 11 multi-edition ISO from Microsoft or get it from MAS.
3. **Run the script:** Copy `WindowsEditionToPro.ps1` to the machine you want to upgrade.  Open an elevated PowerShell (Run as Administrator).
4. **Execute:** At the PowerShell prompt, run:

   ```powershell
   .\WindowsEditionToPro.ps1
   ```
5. **Follow prompts:** The script will prompt you to select or confirm the ISO source, accept the Windows EULA, and enter your Windows 11 Pro product key.
6. **Complete upgrade:** The system will reboot into setup and proceed with the upgrade.  After completion, Windows will be at the Pro edition with your files and apps retained.

**Fallback:** If the automated download via Fido/MAS is not possible (e.g. no internet), simply place the ISO file in the same folder as the script and rerun. The script will detect and use it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings / License

* ‚ö†Ô∏è **License Required:** You **must** have a valid license key for Windows 11 Pro.  The official process requires entering a new edition‚Äôs product key before or during the upgrade. This script does not provide a license or bypass activation.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Legitimate Media:** Only use official or MAS-provided ISOs. The MAS site notes: *‚ÄúAll download links available on our website lead to genuine files only.‚Äù* Always verify you‚Äôre using an unmodified, official ISO (for example, by checking the Microsoft SHA-256 hashes).
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unsupported Paths:** Microsoft documentation shows some edition changes are unsupported (for example, Enterprise‚ÜíPro is marked ‚ùå). This script still attempts such upgrades, but it may behave like a clean install in those cases (keep an extra backup just in case).
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Backup First:** As with any OS upgrade, back up important data before proceeding.
